This repository contains project files from my Microsoft Excel Intermediate course on Myskill. The project demonstrates the practical use of Pivot Tables, Slicers, and Timelines to summarize and analyze large datasets efficiently.
Key Features:

Pivot Table Creation:
Quickly summarize data with fields for filters, columns, rows, and values. Learn how to build tables for analyzing metrics like total revenue by product category or city.

Slicer Integration:
Use slicers as interactive filtering tools to select and display specific data categories, such as product types, with ease.

Timeline Integration:
Incorporate timelines to adjust the date range of the displayed data dynamically, enabling time-based analysis.
